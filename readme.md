#REST-GEAR

##DESCRIPTION:

A simple rest server utility with UI based management that serves resources that are provided in the config. Allows adding multiple URIs to make rest calls to.

Current version supports only GET requests. Future release may include PUT, POST and DELETE.

Runs as a separate process thus not needing to include other libraries such as mockjax within the dev code. Simply use the resulting URI in your AJAX calls as though it was a real backend call.



##INSTALL:

####npm install rest-gear

npm page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/rest-gear



##EXAMPLE:

COMING SOON!
